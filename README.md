# Hangman Game (C++)

This is a simple command-line Hangman game implemented in C++.

## How It Works
- The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- The player has **5 lives** to guess the word, one letter at a time.
- If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position(s).
- If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses a life.
- The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## Features
- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- User input handling with input validation.
- Displays correct guesses while keeping unguessed letters hidden.
- Keeps track of remaining lives and prevents duplicate guesses.
